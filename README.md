# Node Express Mongo Example

This is a sample application demonstrating how to build an Node.js express RESTful application that integrates with MongoDB. You can see the [tutorial here](https://medium.com/@micklynch_6905/angular-6-a-simple-web-application-with-node-and-postgresql-ee2a562887d6)

## Running the application

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start your mongoDB instance. This repo works on an instance running on `localhost:8080`
4. Start the application: `node index.js`
